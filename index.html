			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One of the most important qualities of a good leader is optimism, a pragmatic enthusiasm for what can be achieved. Even in the face of difficult choices and less than ideal outcomes, an optimistic leader does not yield to pessimism. Simply put, people are not motivated or energized by pessimists.&quot;</font></p>

			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Optimism sets a different machine in motion. Especially in difficult moments, the people you lead need to feel confident in your ability to focus on what matters, and not to operate from a place of defensiveness and self-preservation.&quot;</font></p>

			And it&rsquo;s only the beginning of a new era of exceptional Star Wars storytelling; next year we&rsquo;ll release our first standalone movie based on these characters, followed by Star Wars: Episode VIII in 2017, and we&rsquo;ll finish this trilogy with Episode IX in 2019.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;</font></p>

			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Welcome. This site offers a total strategic solution for The Walt Disney Company (hereafter Disney) allowing the company to potentially emulate General Electric, where diversification placed it at the apex of America&#39;s industrial creativity. </font><font face="Arial,
Helvetica, sans-serif">The optimum result of the solution, as implemented by Disney, is a substantial increase in its profitability and an excellent display of Corporate Social Responsibility with the potential&nbsp;for extraordinary benefits to society-at-large. The solution consists of:</font></p>

			<ul>
				<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>a long-term content strategy</b><br />
				Comprises of a new story franchise &quot;Ormus King aka Future Secured&quot; (OK) that the author has created in the form of <a href="http://future-secured.com/8135-2/">8 films</a> (2017-2020.) These stories may compensate for the hurt in the Star Wars fanbase caused by the new Star Wars films (2015-2019.) OK reignites the hero&#39;s journey and places it in a real-world, relatable context that includes messianic prophecy and Israel. These stories may inspire to the same extent as the original Star Wars trilogy (1977-1983) under George Lucas. </font><i><font face="Arial,
Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica,
sans-serif">OK does not necessarily require Disney&#39;s support or partnership for its development and success.</font></font></i><br />
				&nbsp;</li>
				<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>a content presentation strategy</b><br />
				Sets forth a &quot;live performance enablement&quot; business based on the author&#39;s vision and prototype for &quot;<a href="http://future-secured.com/focus/music-startup/">GrooveTip / BopGig</a>&quot; (GT) (2001-2012.)&nbsp; Such a business shows strong, natural synergies with Disney by way of presenting mass-market and niche content providers in the form of live performance </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial,
Helvetica, sans-serif">at real-world venues</font>. It has a focus on touring and free street press. Revenue is primarily through ticket, media and content sales.&nbsp; <i>GT does not necessarily require Disney&#39;s support or partnership for its development and success.</i></font><br />
				&nbsp;</li>
				<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TIGER (Tacit interest gathers expert realization)</b><br />
				A business and social phenomenon to enable <u>Forced Corporation Resignation</u> whereby in the same way people are forced to resign from organizational positions, corporations can also be forced to disband and liquidate by the wider community after public vote. At the same time, TIGER paves the way for business ideas previously suppressed, such as in the realm of free-energy or alternative medicine to take hold through <u>Forced Corporation Creation</u> - protected mass movements around radically beneficial technologies. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial,
Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>TIGER does not necessarily require Bob Iger or Disney&#39;s support or partnership for its development and success. It does require government and military support to a measurable extent. Alternatively, it could piggyback on the influence of, for example, <a href="https://www.startupnationcentral.org/">Start-Up Nation Central</a> which counters <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/">BDS</a>.</i></font></font></li>
